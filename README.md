# NewsletterAPI
This project aims to create a newsletter application using the Spring Boot framework. Through the 'https://worldnewsapi.com' API, the application will collect news from various sources and present them on a web page. Additionally, the project will serve as a training environment to enhance my Java and SpringBoot skills.
